    "### Introduction to NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "- NumPy (Numerical Python) is a Python library that is the core library for scientific computing in Python. \n",
    "- It contains a collection of tools and techniques that can be used to solve mathematical models of problems in science and engineering\n",
    "- One of these tools is a high-performance multidimensional array object that is a powerful data structure for the efficient computation of arrays and matrices.\n",
    "- To work with these arrays, there’s a vast amount of high-level mathematical functions operate on these matrices and arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Learn NumPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Model Inputs Need NumPy Arrays\n",
    "- ML libraries like **Scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, etc. expect data in NumPy array format.\n",
    "- Even Pandas and OpenCV internally rely on NumPy arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. NumPy is Much Faster for Large Numerical Computation\n",
    "- NumPy is written in **optimized C code** under the hood.\n",
    "- It supports:\n",
    "  - Matrix multiplication\n",
    "  - Dot products\n",
    "  - Broadcasting (auto-expanding arrays in operations)\n",
    "- Much faster than native Python loops or lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. NumPy Handles N-Dimensional Arrays\n",
    "- NumPy can create and operate on arrays of any dimension (1D, 2D, 3D, ..., nD).\n",
    "- Useful for:\n",
    "  - Scientific computing\n",
    "  - Deep learning tensors\n",
    "  - Image processing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. You Need NumPy to Build Custom Algorithms\n",
    "- For hands-on ML or from-scratch models, NumPy is essential.\n",
    "- You'll use it for:\n",
    "  - Linear regression\n",
    "  - Gradient descent\n",
    "  - Backpropagation\n",
    "  - Activation functions\n",

    "- Only stores **raw values** (e.g., `int32`, `float64`) — no per-element metadata.\n",
    "- ✅ Very compact: no need to store Python object info for each element.\n",
    "- ✅ Cache-friendly and CPU-efficient.\n",
    "- ✅ Enables **vectorized operations**, **SIMD**, and **broadcasting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result**\n",
    "\n",
    "- NumPy arrays use significantly **less memory** than Python lists.\n",
