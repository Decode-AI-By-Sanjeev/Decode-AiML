    "## Compiled vs Interpreted Languages – A Conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Raj:**  \n",
    "A compiled language is one where the code is first put through a compiler before it is able to be run.  \n",
    "An example is the **C programming language**. To run C code, first you have to run a compiler like `gcc` or `clang`, and then finally you can run your code.  \n",
    "A compiled language gets converted to **machine code**—the ones and zeroes that your CPU understands.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anjali:**  \n",
    "But wait, isn’t **Java** a compiled language?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Raj:**  \n",
    "Yes, Java is a compiled language.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anjali:**  \n",
    "But isn’t the output of the regular Java compiler a `.class` file? That’s **bytecode**, isn’t it?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Raj:**  \n",
    "That’s correct. Bytecode isn’t machine code, but Java is still a compiled language.  \n",
    "This is because there are many problems that the **compiler can catch**, so you will need to correct errors **before your program starts running**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anjali:**  \n",
    "What about **interpreted languages**?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Raj:**  \n",
    "An interpreted language is one that relies on a separate program, aptly called an **interpreter**, to actually run your code.  \n",
    "An interpreted language does not require the programmer to run a compiler first.  \n",
    "Because of this, any errors that you make will be **caught while your program is running**.  \n",
    "**Python** is an interpreted language—there is no separate compiler, and all errors that you make are caught at **runtime**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anjali:**  \n",
    "If Python is not a compiled language, then why does the standard library include modules called `py_compile` and `compileall`?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Raj:**  \n",
    "Well, those modules just convert Python to **bytecode**.  \n",
    "They don’t convert Python to **machine code**, so Python is still considered an **interpreted language**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anjali:**  \n",
    "So, both Python and Java are converted to **bytecode**?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Raj:**  \n",
    "Correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anjali:**  \n",
    "Then how is Python an interpreted language and yet Java is a compiled language instead?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Raj:**  \n",
    "Because all errors in Python are caught at **runtime**.\n"
